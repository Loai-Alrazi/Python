# Gym Membership Management System

This project demonstrates the evolution of a Python application from basic scripts to advanced OOP with data persistence.

## Versions:
- **v1 (Basic)**: Focuses on core logic and loops.
- **v2 (Inheritance)**: Implements OOP principles with `Person` and `User` classes.
- **v3 (JSON Integration)**: Adds data persistence, so users are saved in a `gym_data.json` file.

## Features:
- Add, search, and display users.
- Automatic data saving and loading.
- Input validation (ID must be numeric).
