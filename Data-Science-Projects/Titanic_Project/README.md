# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster 🚢

This project predicts passenger survival using the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

### 🔄 Project Stages:
- **Phase 1 (Titanic_Data.ipynb)**: Initial exploration, data cleaning, and handling missing values in Age/Cabin.
- **Phase 2 (titanic_data_final.ipynb)**: Final model building using **Random Forest**.

### 📊 Model Performance:
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier.
- **Key Metric**: Achieved **81.56% Accuracy**.
- **Insights**: Features like Sex, Pclass, and Age were the most important factors in the model.
